# Absolutely Based Bread Recipe

## Ingredients
Yudane:
- 50g bread flour
- 50g boiling water

(Make this 30 mins before the dough and let it cool)

Bread:
- 200g bread flour
- 1 1/8 tsp instant yeast
- 2 Tbsp (15g) brown sugar
- 3/4 tsp salt
- 15g butter
- 145g fresh milk or full cream milk (reserve 25g)

Egg Wash:
- 1 egg + a little water mixed well (i try to do mostly the yolk)

## Schedule
- Wet ingredients + sugar in
- Dry ingredients in 
- Add two dimples in the flour, one for the salt and one for yeast
- Put the bread machine on "pizza dough" mode
- While it kneads, add in the yudane and butter bit by bit

1ST PROOFING (45-60 minutes or until double in size --> can also retard dough in fridge)

- Shape!!!!
  - 2 rolls (breadmachine)
  - 6 balls (breadmachine)
  - 

FINAL PROOFING (45-90 minutes depending on environ. temp.)

- Poke test!
    - Under-proofed dough: Will spring back quickly
    - Properly proofed dough: Will slowly spring back, filling the indentation partially.
    - Over-proofed dough: Will not spring back at all, indicating that the dough has risen too much and could collapse in the oven. 

EGG WASH AND BAKE!! (use breadmachine settings)

- Dump the bread out and let cool on a rack overnight before cutting
- DO NOT REFRIDGERATE
