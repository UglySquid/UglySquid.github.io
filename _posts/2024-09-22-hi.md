Hello Hello Hello pookies

I never really thought about coding as something I enjoyed before I made this. But, this project made me realize that even though I find errors and debugging annoying, I also get really immersed and lose track of time. 

I guess if you want advice on figuring out what you "really" want to do in uni, think back to all your little activities and see what saps up your time in the least noticeable way!

Hehe,
