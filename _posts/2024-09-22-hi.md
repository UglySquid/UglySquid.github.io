Hello Hello Hello pookies

After spending numerous, countless, infinite, and even more hours on setting "this" up, I have no regrets. Because somehow, time just fizzles out when I do things like "this." To the point where I am considering "this" as a carer. Sure, "this" was long, arduous, tedious, annoying, yet, I couldn't stop! 

What do i mean by "this"? I guess this blog site. Installing ruby on MacOS is painful when you do it wrong the first time :D

In general, what I really mean by "this" is coding and problem solving. I tend to forget I like doing this stuff most of the time?

I guess if you want advice on figuring out what you "really" want to do in uni, think back to all your little activities and see what saps up your time in the least noticeable way. 

Love,
UglySquid hehe <3
