## Hi pookie~!

My name's Christine but you can call me Chris ðŸ˜»

I'm currently an IBDP student at Milliken Mills Highschool hoping to become a first year computer science student at University of Waterloo.

I enjoy various CAS (Creativity, Activity, and Service) in my spare time, and NOT just because it goes towards my diploma. I say "various" because there are many many CAS activities scattered sporadically throughout my timeline. 

## This website:
It's cooler than a README file and I needed this repository to host things on GitHub Pages :sorriest_sorry_ever:

If you expected something more, there might be some writing in the future?1!!
